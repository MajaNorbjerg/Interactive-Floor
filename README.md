# Interactive-Floor
A prototype I made for my main assignment on the multimediadesign education using `Godot` and `C#`.

## How to exit the game (Read this before you run the game)
The game displays in full screen, so to close it you can do the following
- Press `Alt + Tab` to return to another program
- Go to your processbar, find the blue fellow and close the windows

#### OR

- Press the windows-button
- Go to your processbar, find the blue fellow and close the windows

## How to run the program (Windows only)
- Go to the latest release called `Interactive-floor_mouse-only_program_Windows` (It sould be at the right side of the screen).
- Download the `InteractiveFloor_Prototype_Mouse-only.zip
` file.
- Extract the folder when ready
- Run the file `floor_mouse-only.exe`

To get the best experience with the game. Your display resolution for your screen should be 1920 x 1080.

### How to play the game
Use your mouse to catch the ginerbread men. There´s a yellow box around the mouse to indicate the detection area of a person.


### Go save christmas from the naughty gingerbread men!

## The code
In this repository you´ll find a snippet from the entire projet, so this won´t run alone in Godot.
The code available functions game mecanics only.
